# Folder-synchronization

This repository houses a Python script designed for folder synchronization. It efficiently mirrors files and directories from a source folder to a destination folder, ensuring both locations are kept in sync.

This Python script is designed to perform folder synchronization. It ensures that two folders (a source and a destination) are kept in sync by mirroring their contents. This includes copying new and updated files from the source to the destination and removing files from the destination that no longer exist in the source. This script can be used for backup purposes, automated file management, or any scenario where folder content synchronization is required.
